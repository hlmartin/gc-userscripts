# [DEPRECATED] Active Pet in Sidebar

## This script is now deprecated as of 09/12/2024

Do you miss seeing your active pet in the sidebar like on retail?

This script will add a new section to the AIO sidebar to display your active pet as you play Grundo's Cafe.

## Usage

After installing the script, the "Active Pet" section will display and prompt you to visit your Quickref page. That's it!

**Note:** Any time you update a pet (such as by adopting, trading, painting, flasking, morphing, zapping, etc.), you will need to visit the Quickref page.

## Changelog

**1.0.0:** Initial release.

## TODO

  * Support for custom pet overlays
  * Support for displaying a pet apart from your active pet
  * Bugfix: Going to [Pet Preferences](https://www.grundos.cafe/quickref/adjustposition/) breaks saved images
